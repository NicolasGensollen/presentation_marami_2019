## Abstract

In this paper, we study the interplay between social ties and financial transactions made through a recent crypto-currency called [G1](https://g1.duniter.fr/#/app/home). It has the particularity of combining a network of identified users with the usual transaction record. We show in this preliminary version of the paper that although the social and transaction networks are correlated on various aspects, the impact of social ties on transactions is larger than its converse.
